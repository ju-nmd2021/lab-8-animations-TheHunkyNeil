                <h2>Introduction to Pop</h2><img src="images/sks.jpg" width="200">
                <p>Pop music is a kind of music style, which refers to music created with the main purpose of catering
                    to the tastes of a broad audience. It is commercial music entertainment and all related "industrial"
                    phenomena. Its marketability is primary, and its artistry is secondary. Popular music originated in
                    the United States at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. From the
                    perspective of the music system, popular music is music developed on the basis of American popular
                    music structures such as Ding Bang Alley music, blues, jazz, rock music, and Thor music. Its styles
                    are diverse and rich in forms, which can generally refer to urban mass music born after the 20th
                    century, such as Jazz, Rock, Soul, Blues, Reggae, Rap, Hip-Hop, Disco, and New Age.<br />

                        Composed by：Xavier Dphrepaulezz<br>
                        <br>
                        That's when everything went wrong<br>
                        Now that's when everything went wrong<br>
                        I lay down to die on the concrete floor<br>
                        Now that's when everything went wrong<br>
                        ９９ ways that you're willing to die<br>
                        Break your mama heart now she startin to cry<br>
                        Broken beer bottles that are starting to fly<br>
                        I know my time is coming soon<br>
                        ７ foot goon lined up in the room<br>
                        Kickin up dust in the shadow of doom<br>
                        Temper start to flare now they're starting to fume<br>
                        I know my time is coming soon<br>
                        That's when everything went wrong<br>
                        Now that's when everything went wrong<br>
                        I lay down to die on the concrete floor<br>
                        Now that's when everything went wrong<br>
                        That's when everything went wrong<br>
                        Now that's when everything went wrong<br>
                        I lay down to die on the concrete floor<br>
                        Now that's when everything went wrong<br>
                        The devils coming after me<br>
                        The devils coming after me<br>
                        I ran past a neighbor sitting on da sidewalk sippin<br>
                        On a beer till my friends came looking for me<br>
                        I don't smoke no more<br>
                        That's when everything went wrong<br>
                        Now that's when everything went wrong<br>
                        I lay down to die on the concrete floor<br>
                        Now that's when everything went wrong<br>
                        That's when everything went wrong<br>
                        Now that's when everything went wrong<br>
                        I lay down to die on the concrete floor<br>
                        Now that's when everything went wrong<br>
