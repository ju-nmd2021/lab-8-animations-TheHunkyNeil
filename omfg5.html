        <h2>Introduction to Pop</h2><img src="images/sks.jpg" width="200">
        <p>Pop music is a kind of music style, which refers to music created with the main purpose of catering
          to the tastes of a broad audience. It is commercial music entertainment and all related "industrial"
          phenomena. Its marketability is primary, and its artistry is secondary. Popular music originated in
          the United States at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. From the
          perspective of the music system, popular music is music developed on the basis of American popular
          music structures such as Ding Bang Alley music, blues, jazz, rock music, and Thor music. Its styles
          are diverse and rich in forms, which can generally refer to urban mass music born after the 20th
          century, such as Jazz, Rock, Soul, Blues, Reggae, Rap, Hip-Hop, Disco, and New Age.<br />
