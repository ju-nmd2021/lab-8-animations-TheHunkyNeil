                <h2>Introduction to Pop</h2><img src="images/sks.jpg" width="200">
                <p>Pop music is a kind of music style, which refers to music created with the main purpose of catering
                    to the tastes of a broad audience. It is commercial music entertainment and all related "industrial"
                    phenomena. Its marketability is primary, and its artistry is secondary. Popular music originated in
                    the United States at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. From the
                    perspective of the music system, popular music is music developed on the basis of American popular
                    music structures such as Ding Bang Alley music, blues, jazz, rock music, and Thor music. Its styles
                    are diverse and rich in forms, which can generally refer to urban mass music born after the 20th
                    century, such as Jazz, Rock, Soul, Blues, Reggae, Rap, Hip-Hop, Disco, and New Age.<br />

                        Lyrics by：Alexander Seaver<br>
                        Composed by：Alexander Seaver<br>
                        <br>
                        Hold the die your turn to roll<br>
                        Before they fall through your fingers<br>
                        Not a good night to lose control<br>
                        Right as the earth is unraveling<br>
                        You play with your blocks until they break<br>
                        And these walls come tumbling down<br>
                        Oh they're tumbling down<br>
                        You're out time make your move<br>
                        Live or die while the fuse is lit and there's no turning back<br>
                        Kiss your perfect day goodbye<br>
                        Because the world is on fire<br>
                        Tuck your innocence goodnight<br>
                        You sold your friends like guns for hire<br>
                        Go play with your blocks<br>
                        And now you'll pay when these walls come tumbling down<br>
                        Oh they're tumbling down<br>
                        Resting on a knife you heavy souls<br>
                        With all this weight buckling down on you now<br>
                        Don't you drown and float away<br>
                        Not a good time to lose control<br>
                        Right as your marionettes cut their strings and run away<br>
                        You're out time make your move<br>
                        Live or die while the fuse is lit and there's no turning back<br>
                        Kiss your perfect day goodbye<br>
                        Because the world is on fire<br>
                        Tuck your innocence goodnight<br>
                        You sold your friends like guns for hire<br>
                        Go play with your blocks<br>
                        And now you'll pay when these walls come tumbling down<br>
                        Oh they're tumbling down<br>
