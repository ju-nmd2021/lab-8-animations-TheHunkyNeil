				<h2>Introduction to Pop</h2><img src="images/sks.jpg" width="200">
				<p>Pop music is a kind of music style, which refers to music created with the main purpose of catering
					to the tastes of a broad audience. It is commercial music entertainment and all related "industrial"
					phenomena. Its marketability is primary, and its artistry is secondary. Popular music originated in
					the United States at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. From the
					perspective of the music system, popular music is music developed on the basis of American popular
					music structures such as Ding Bang Alley music, blues, jazz, rock music, and Thor music. Its styles
					are diverse and rich in forms, which can generally refer to urban mass music born after the 20th
					century, such as Jazz, Rock, Soul, Blues, Reggae, Rap, Hip-Hop, Disco, and New Age.<br />

						Dynasties and Dystopia - Denzel Curry/Gizzle/Bren Joy <br>

						Lyrics by：Denzel Rae Don Curry/Glenda Proby/Brennen Joy<br>

						Composed by：Denzel Curry/Glenda Proby/Brennen Joy/Sebastien Najand<br>
						<br>

						Ooo yeah he mad<br>

						I'm racking up white diamonds<br>

						Throw me in the sky<br>

						You would swear the sun shining<br>

						Ooo yeah he mad<br>

						I'm racking up white diamonds<br>

						Throw me in the sky<br>

						You would swear the sun shining<br>

						In this gothic underground city<br>

						We all sin<br>

						If I bring a couple rounds with me<br>

						Then we all win<br>

						I came back and brought the crown with me<br>

						The king's den<br>

						Break your nexus break and your neck 'cause<br>

						Everybody's on your head<br>

						Just might kick your butt<br>

						Go run amok then paint my nails<br>

						Never learned to raise my hand<br>

						Was too busy raising hell<br>

						Everything I know I am<br>

						You should go and save yourself<br>

						Thought you had my number huh<br>

						Congratulations you played yourself<br>

						Underground utopia dynasties and dystopia<br>

						Fear is never a option so dying's not a real phobia<br>

						I'm beating the odds<br>

						Rising to every occasion as if I defeated the gods<br>

						Switch of the mod<br>
						Nothing but champions rolled into one little squad<br>

						Hold still while I bag that<br>

						Uh<br>

						Talk bad till I snap back<br>

						Uh<br>

						This ain't brown this that dark black<br>

						This that pitch black jet black<br>

						Snap yo ex watch me give him flashbacks<br>

						Pressure's rising fast as lighting they can't stop it now<br>

						If you ain't talking realness then just change the topic now<br>

						They laughing at the top like they can't see the bottom<br>

						And they thought I needed help but I got here without them<br>

						I am sharper than a pack of 100 razor blades<br>

						When the smoke clears outta her bet they name gon fade<br>

						I'ma be here doing it doing it my way<br>

						They said I should I change it up<br>

						But what did I say<br>

						Ooo yeah he mad<br>

						I'm racking up white diamonds<br>

						Throw me in the sky<br>

						You would swear the sun shining<br>

						Ooo yeah he mad<br>

						I'm racking up white diamonds<br>

						Throw me in the sky<br>

						You would swear the sun shining<br>

						Hold still while I bag that<br>
