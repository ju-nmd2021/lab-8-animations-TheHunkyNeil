            Heavy metal music is like a black hole in the universe with extraordinary magical powers, making you unable
            to control yourself in front of it.

            music, the singer who wants to pierce the sky, the guitar solo like a thousand miles...heavy metal music is
            like a high-speed train A moving train with no purpose...
            After mankind entered the industrial society, the sounds that modern people hear the most are no longer the
            sounds of nature. Instead, they are noises. Various noises in factories, streets, homes, etc. have been
            produced by human wisdom and civilization. Surrounded, the noise can be regarded as the "sound of the
            times".
            Heavy metal music should be the most extreme and perfect embodiment of humans' acoustic effects in this era.
            The biggest feature of heavy metal is noise and distortion, and this effect is mainly created by guitarists.
            The huge noise of heavy metal music comes from electric guitars.
