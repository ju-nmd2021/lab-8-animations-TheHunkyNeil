				<h2>Introduction to Pop</h2><img src="images/sks.jpg" width="200">
				<p>Pop music is a kind of music style, which refers to music created with the main purpose of catering
					to the tastes of a broad audience. It is commercial music entertainment and all related "industrial"
					phenomena. Its marketability is primary, and its artistry is secondary. Popular music originated in
					the United States at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. From the
					perspective of the music system, popular music is music developed on the basis of American popular
					music structures such as Ding Bang Alley music, blues, jazz, rock music, and Thor music. Its styles
					are diverse and rich in forms, which can generally refer to urban mass music born after the 20th
					century, such as Jazz, Rock, Soul, Blues, Reggae, Rap, Hip-Hop, Disco, and New Age.<br />

						Lyrics by：Alexander Seaver<br>
						Composed by：Alexander Seaver/Sebastien Najand<br>
						<br>

						Who told you what was down here<br>
						Come along if you wanted a peek<br>
						I've seen your face around here<br>
						Come alone tell me under the table<br>
						What do you seek<br>
						Welcome to the playground follow me<br>
						Tell me your nightmares and fantasies<br>
						Sink into the wasteland underneath<br>
						Stay for the night I'll sell you a dream<br>
						Ohh Welcome to the playground<br>
						What brings you to the lost and found dear<br>
						Won't you pull up a seat<br>
						Everybody got a price 'round here to play<br>
						Make me an offer what will it be<br>
						Oh what will it be<br>
						Welcome to the playground follow me<br>
						Tell me your nightmares and fantasies<br>
						Sink into the wasteland underneath<br>
						Stay for the night I'll sell you a dream<br>
						Ohh Welcome to the playground<br>
						Ohh Welcome to the playground<br>
						Welcome to the playground<br>
						Welcome to the playground<br>
						Welcome to the playground follow me<br>
						Tell me your nightmares and fantasies<br>
						Sink into the wasteland underneath<br>
						Stay for the night I'll sell you a dream<br>
