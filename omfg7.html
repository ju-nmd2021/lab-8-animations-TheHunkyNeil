        <h2>Introduction to Pop</h2><img src="images/sks.jpg" width="200">
        <p>Pop music is a kind of music style, which refers to music created with the main purpose of catering
          to the tastes of a broad audience. It is commercial music entertainment and all related "industrial"
          phenomena. Its marketability is primary, and its artistry is secondary. Popular music originated in
          the United States at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. From the
          perspective of the music system, popular music is music developed on the basis of American popular
          music structures such as Ding Bang Alley music, blues, jazz, rock music, and Thor music. Its styles
          are diverse and rich in forms, which can generally refer to urban mass music born after the 20th
          century, such as Jazz, Rock, Soul, Blues, Reggae, Rap, Hip-Hop, Disco, and New Age.<br />

            You would not believe your eyes <br />
            If ten million fireflies <br />
            Lit up the world as I fell asleep <br />
            Cause they fill the open air <br />
            And leave teardrops everywhere <br />
            You'd think me rude but I wouuld just stand and stare <br />
            I'd like to make myself believe<br />
            That planet earth turns slowly <br />
            It's hard to say that I'd rather stay <br />
            Awake when I'm asleep <br />
            Cause everything is never as it seems <br />
            Cause I'd get a thousand hugs <br />
            From ten thousand lightning bugs <br />
            As they tried to teach me how to dance <br />
            A foxtrot above my head <br />
            A sockhop beneath my bed <br />
            A disco ball is just hanging by a thread <br />
            I'd like to make myself believe <br />
            That planet earth turns slowly <br />
            It's hard to say that I'd rather stay <br />
            Awake when I'm asleep <br />
            Cause everything is never as it seems <br />
            When I fall asleep <br />
            Leave my door open just a crack <br />
            Please take me away from here <br />
            Cause I feel like such an insomniac <br />
            Please take me away from here <br />
            Why do I tire of counting sheep <br />
            Please take me away from here <br />
            When I'm far too tired to fall asleep <br />
            To ten million fireflies <br />
            I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes <br />
            I got misty eyes as they said farewell <br />
            But I'll know where several are <br />
            If my dreams get real bizzare <br />
            Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar <br />
            I'd like To make myself believe <br />
            That Planet earth turns slowly <br />
            It's hard to say that I'd rather stay <br />
            Awake when I'm asleep <br />
            Cause everything is never as it seems <br />
            When I fall asleep <br />
            I'd like to make myself believe<br />
            That planet earth turns slowly <br />
            It's hard to say that I'd rather stay <br />

            It's hard to say I'd rather stay <br />
            Awake when I'm asleep <br />
            Because my dreams are bursting at the sea</p>
