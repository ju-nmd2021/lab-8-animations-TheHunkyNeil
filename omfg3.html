				<h2>Introduction to Pop</h2><img src="images/sks.jpg" width="200">
				<p>Pop music is a kind of music style, which refers to music created with the main purpose of catering
					to the tastes of a broad audience. It is commercial music entertainment and all related "industrial"
					phenomena. Its marketability is primary, and its artistry is secondary. Popular music originated in
					the United States at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. From the
					perspective of the music system, popular music is music developed on the basis of American popular
					music structures such as Ding Bang Alley music, blues, jazz, rock music, and Thor music. Its styles
					are diverse and rich in forms, which can generally refer to urban mass music born after the 20th
					century, such as Jazz, Rock, Soul, Blues, Reggae, Rap, Hip-Hop, Disco, and New Age.<br />
