				<h2>Introduction to Pop</h2><img src="images/sks.jpg" width="200">
				<p>Pop music is a kind of music style, which refers to music created with the main purpose of catering
					to the tastes of a broad audience. It is commercial music entertainment and all related "industrial"
					phenomena. Its marketability is primary, and its artistry is secondary. Popular music originated in
					the United States at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. From the
					perspective of the music system, popular music is music developed on the basis of American popular
					music structures such as Ding Bang Alley music, blues, jazz, rock music, and Thor music. Its styles
					are diverse and rich in forms, which can generally refer to urban mass music born after the 20th
					century, such as Jazz, Rock, Soul, Blues, Reggae, Rap, Hip-Hop, Disco, and New Age.<br />

					<p>CLASSICAL MUSIC, translated into "classical music" in Chinese, some people think that "classical"
						has an antique and old-fashioned taste, so it was renamed "classical music". According to the
						definition of classical in the Oxford English Dictionary, in traditional
						and serious style, and call it "serious music". As a result, "classical music" was again put on
						a "serious" hat, making people even more afraid to approach it. <br />
						But the person who defines this definition must not look up the dictionary carefully, because
						the second meaning of serious is defined like this: (referring to books, music, etc.), it is not
						only for entertainment, but for inspiring thinking. Therefore, we know that the original
						classical music is different from popular music in that it has profound connotations, can
						inspire thought, and can make people noble and free from vulgarity. <br />
						Let’s look at the Longman dictionary’s interpretation of classical music music that people
						consider serious and that has been popular for a long
						time. It can be seen that classical music is the music that has stood the test of time, has a
						long history, and is loved by everyone. Classical music is an independent genre, and its
						artistic techniques emphasize refinement and the pursuit of rational expression of emotions.
