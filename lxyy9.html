                <h2>Introduction to Pop</h2><img src="images/sks.jpg" width="200">
                <p>Pop music is a kind of music style, which refers to music created with the main purpose of catering
                    to the tastes of a broad audience. It is commercial music entertainment and all related "industrial"
                    phenomena. Its marketability is primary, and its artistry is secondary. Popular music originated in
                    the United States at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. From the
                    perspective of the music system, popular music is music developed on the basis of American popular
                    music structures such as Ding Bang Alley music, blues, jazz, rock music, and Thor music. Its styles
                    are diverse and rich in forms, which can generally refer to urban mass music born after the 20th
                    century, such as Jazz, Rock, Soul, Blues, Reggae, Rap, Hip-Hop, Disco, and New Age.<br />

                        Lyrics by：Alexander Seaver<br>
                        Composed by：Alexander Seaver<br>
                        <br>
                        I can hear the sound of a heartbeat before it goes out<br>
                        Won't ever leave my memory of bloodshed all around<br>
                        I can see a tear on my father's face before it falls out<br>
                        Oh my enemy how could I have ever let you down oh<br>
                        When all these trees saw us grow cut our teeth and make our bones right here<br>
                        We'd play with shields made of stone share our dreams and sit our thrones<br>
                        Be still 'cause I see smoke up ahead and I got steel in my hands<br>
                        We will return like warriors I swear that we'll find glory up ahead<br>
                        Tell me where is my home<br>
                        I don't recognize the faces anymore no<br>
                        Where is my friend<br>
                        The one I've known since I was only just a kid<br>
                        I think it's time to say goodbye<br>
                        Goodbye Goodbye<br>
                        Goodbye Goodbye woh<br>
                        It's time to say Goodbye<br>
                        Goodbye Goodbye<br>
                        Goodbye Goodbye woh<br>
                        It's time to say goodbye<br>
                        Goodbye Goodbye<br>
                        Goodbye Goodbye woh<br>
                        It's time to say Goodbye<br>
                        Goodbye Goodbye<br>
                        Goodbye Goodbye woh<br>
                        Is it time to say goodbye<br>
                        Goodbye Goodbye<br>
                        Goodbye Goodbye woh<br>
